        <dc:description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;God's Debris&lt;/em&gt; is the first non-&lt;em&gt;Dilbert&lt;/em&gt;, non-humor book by best-selling author Scott Adams. Adams describes &lt;em&gt;God's Debris&lt;/em&gt; as a thought experiment wrapped in a story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine that you meet a very old man who you eventually realize knows literally everything. Imagine that he explains for you the great mysteries of life: quantum physics, evolution, God, gravity, light psychic phenomenon, and probability in a way so simple, so novel, and so compelling that it all fits together and makes perfect sense. What does it feel like to suddenly understand everything?  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may not find the final answer to the big question, but &lt;em&gt;God's Debris&lt;/em&gt; might provide the most compelling vision of reality you will ever read. The thought experiment is this: Try to figure out what's wrong with the old man's explanation of reality. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Amazon Review&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scott Adams, creator of the popular comic strip "Dilbert," has written a modern-day parable about a young man and an unlikely mentor. &lt;em&gt;God's Debris&lt;/em&gt; starts with a young deliveryman trying to hand over a package to an old man with a San Francisco address. But delivering the package proves to be as difficult as trying to understand the meaning of God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deliveryman begins to realize that he's not dealing with a feeble-minded old man; he's dealing with a situation that could alter his life. The sincerity and metaphysical complexity of this fable will surprise those who expect comedy, but Adams is following a tradition set by such writers as Dan Millman (&lt;em&gt;Way of the Peaceful Warrior&lt;/em&gt;) and Richard Bach (&lt;em&gt;Illusions&lt;/em&gt;). As in many parables that have come before, the deliveryman learns the meaning of life from an illusive mentor who seems to arise from a wrinkle in time. The cleverness of the &lt;i&gt;God's Debris&lt;/i&gt; concept is original and bound to leave readers pondering some altered definitions of God, the universe, and just about everything else. &lt;em&gt;--Gail Hudson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
